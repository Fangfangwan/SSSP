Corpus: CLMET3

Topic 1: Semantic Change
•	Unit: Period (as in CLMET3 data, somewhat ambiguous, needs refinement)
•	Step 1: calculate word count and relative frequency (total, and across different period) using MapReduce
•	Step 2: calculate semantic change, align word2vec models to keep only common vocabularies that appear in documents of every period. (21257 words for CLMET3)
•	Step 3: calculate polysemy

Question 1:
•	Rate of semantic change vs relative frequency
(Assumption: more frequently used words tend to go through less semantic change)
Question 2:
•	Rate of semantic change vs polysemy
(Assumption: polysemy words tend to have more semantic change overtime)
